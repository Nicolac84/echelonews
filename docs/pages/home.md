EcheloNews is a news multiplexer; basically, it fetches news from all over the
world, classifying them by topic and giving them back to users according to
their preferences.

## Documentation

### RESTful APIs

EcheloNews internal and external RESTful APIs are designed and built as a set
of OpenAPI3 YAML specifications. To view them, you can visit the following
links:

* [Exposed API]({{ site.url }}/openapi/external)
* [Internal User Handler]({{ site.url }}/openapi/users)
* [News Organizer]({{ site.url }}/openapi/organizer)

### Libraries and Programming APIs

Libraries (and code portions in general) are documented with JSDoc; the
documentation is available at the following links:

* [Models documentation]({{ site.url }}/jsdoc/models)
* [Library documentation]({{ site.url }}/jsdoc/library)

## Architecture

EcheloNews is designed as a set of loosely coupled modules, which can be easily
turned into microservices. The architecture is described as follows:

**NOTE**:

* Red edges represents external interactions
* Green edges represents internal RESTful calls
* Orange edges represents internal AMQP calls

## Modules

### RESTful API
The main EcheloNews interface, built on top of standard HTTP verbs with the
REST paradigm and delivered as SaaS. It interfaces with a plethora of separated,
independent microservices to provide EcheloNews functionalities.

### Web Frontend
A website frontend, built on top of the RESTful API; in practice, it uses the
API as it were an external service, being almost completely separated from the
infrastructure.

User sessions are implemented using the JWTs generated by the RESTful API as
stateless session cookies.

OAuth users are handled directly, as user authentication through the provider
must be performed using a browser. However, by interfacing with the _OAuth
bridge_, the frontend is not aware of any user implementation detail.

### News fetcher
Fetch news via the RSS protocol from various websites (with long-time
polling), and pass them to the news organizer as a JSON object.

A _last-fetched timestamp_ is used in combination with the `If-Modified-Since`
HTTP header to avoid fetching (and wasting computational resources with)
obsolete news.

### News organizer
Organize news and save them in a permanent data structure (e.g. SQL database),
offering a simple RESTful service.

Using a separated module to organize and store the news makes the EcheloNews
infrustructure much more scalable and, on top of all, resilient. Let's say a
new module which fetches news doing web scraping is introduced; the only thing
to do in that case is develop it separately and plug it into the organizer.

This sticks with and satisfies the _Open Close Principle_ (one should need to
just add and not to modify).

### News multiplexer
Multiplex news according to topic or category and return them to a user
interface microservice (on-demand).
The news multiplexer calls the Google Cloud Translate API to translate news
feeds' description and title

### OAuth Bridge
Act as a bridge between the _Web Frontend_ and the _User Handler_. This way,
the frontend does not need to know anything about the way inwhich JWT tokens
are generated, nor to access the database in any way.
